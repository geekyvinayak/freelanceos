# FreelanceOS Database Setup & Demo Data

This directory contains all the necessary SQL scripts to set up the FreelanceOS database and populate it with demo data.

## üìÅ Files Overview

- **`schema.sql`** - Complete database schema with tables, triggers, and RLS policies
- **`demo-data-auto.sql`** - Automatic demo data insertion (recommended)
- **`demo-data.sql`** - Manual demo data insertion (requires UUID replacement)
- **`verify-demo-data.sql`** - Verification script to check demo data
- **`seed.sql`** - Basic seed data template

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Database Schema Setup

First, run the schema script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of schema.sql
```

This creates:
- ‚úÖ Tables: `projects`, `notes`, `bills`
- ‚úÖ Custom types: `project_status`, `bill_status`
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ‚úÖ Triggers for `updated_at` timestamps
- ‚úÖ Indexes for performance
- ‚úÖ Invoice number generation function

### 2. Create Demo User

The demo user should already exist if you created it through the FreelanceOS auth system:
- **Email**: `user@demo.com`
- **Password**: `Demo@123`

If not, create it through your Supabase Auth dashboard or the FreelanceOS signup form.

### 3. Insert Demo Data (Automatic)

Run the automatic demo data script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of demo-data-auto.sql
```

This automatically:
- ‚úÖ Finds the demo user by email
- ‚úÖ Clears any existing demo data
- ‚úÖ Inserts 6 realistic projects
- ‚úÖ Adds 15 project notes
- ‚úÖ Creates 9 invoices/bills
- ‚úÖ Shows success confirmation

### 4. Verify Demo Data

Run the verification script to confirm everything was inserted correctly:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of verify-demo-data.sql
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Demo User Not Found
If you get an error about demo user not found:

1. Check if the user exists:
```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'user@demo.com';
```

2. If not found, create the user through:
   - FreelanceOS signup form
   - Supabase Auth dashboard
   - Direct SQL insertion (not recommended)

### Data Already Exists
The automatic script clears existing demo data. If you want to keep existing data:

1. Comment out these lines in `demo-data-auto.sql`:
```sql
-- DELETE FROM bills WHERE project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE user_id = demo_user_id);
-- DELETE FROM notes WHERE project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE user_id = demo_user_id);
-- DELETE FROM projects WHERE user_id = demo_user_id;
```

### RLS Policy Issues
If you get permission errors:

1. Ensure RLS policies are properly set up
2. Check that the demo user is authenticated
3. Verify the user_id matches in all tables

## üìà Customizing Demo Data

To modify the demo data:

1. **Edit project details** in the INSERT statements
2. **Adjust amounts** and dates as needed
3. **Add more notes** or bills for richer data
4. **Change project statuses** to show different scenarios

## üîç Monitoring Demo Usage

Track demo user activity:

```sql
-- Recent demo user activity
SELECT 
    'projects' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as records,
    MAX(updated_at) as last_activity
FROM projects p
JOIN auth.users u ON p.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email = 'user@demo.com'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'notes' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as records,
    MAX(n.updated_at) as last_activity
FROM notes n
JOIN projects p ON n.project_id = p.id
JOIN auth.users u ON p.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email = 'user@demo.com'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'bills' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as records,
    MAX(b.updated_at) as last_activity
FROM bills b
JOIN projects p ON b.project_id = p.id
JOIN auth.users u ON p.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email = 'user@demo.com';
```
